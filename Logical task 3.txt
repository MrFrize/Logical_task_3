Each pair of bowers should be placed perpendicular to other pair and the bowers in pair placed parallely.
One helper should help me to take care of bowers to endure and place bowers.
Other 2 helper should take hammers and nails and nail bowers since we place them.
Nails should be placed on both sides of the each bower.
